### Firmware for the Rodent Stimulation Module Project

The most recent version of the firmware is [FirmwareCode/](FirmwareCode/). Firmware
for older, non NFC-controlled devices is in [Old_NoNFC/](Old_NoNFC).
[BoardTest/](BoardTest/) is a simple program which blinks the LED to test whether the
MSP430 is programming correctly (in the future, we'll add tests of the other devices on board
to this code).
