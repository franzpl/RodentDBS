Rodent Stimulation Module Project
=========

<img src="AppCode/Graphics/Feature.png">

Rodent-scale open source programmable constant current deep brain stimulation system. Runs on a
low power MSP430 microcontroller from Texas Instrumnents. Interfaces with an Android app using
Near Field Communication (NFC).

   - The [Firmware/](Firmware/) directory contains the code which runs on the MSP430. 
   - The [AppCode/](AppCode/) directory contains the Android Studio project and code for the
     NFC controller app.
   - The [PCBs/](PCBs/) directory contains the design files for the printed circuit board
     hardware.

#### Physical Size of Devices In Action

The most recent version of the hardware is about 1/4" thick including a CR2032 battery, and a
little larger than a quarter in footprint. Battery life is about 200 hours. In photos above,
major grid is 1/2".

#### Biphasic Constant Current Stimulation

Current measurements (voltage over the series 10 K resistor)
for a 90 µA, 60 µs, 120 Hz stimulation settings.
